## About

<img class="profile-picture" src="FB_IMG_1611674150846.jpg">

Welcome, I'm Henrique! I'm a 20 year old undergraduate of the Linguistics & Literature program at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), in Brazil. I'm a Scientific Initiation Scholarship student in the project "Uneasy Textualities: between strange fruits and contemporary expansions".

I'm mostly interested in the literary theory and comparative literature fields, especially in studies of Gothic literature and horror.
