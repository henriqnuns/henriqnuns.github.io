## About

<img class="profile-picture" src="FB_IMG_1611674150846.jpg">

Welcome, I'm Henrique! I'm a 20 year old undergraduate of the Linguistics & Literature program at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), in Brazil.

I'm mostly interested in the literary theory and comparative literature fields, especially in studies of Gothic literature and horror.
